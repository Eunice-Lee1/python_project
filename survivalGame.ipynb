    "Project Description: The Survival Game's goal is to survive seven days without reaching a health of zero by doing a series of tasks necessary for survival. \n",
    "\n",
    "I have built a class called Player that creates the player of the game with the initial amount of resources and allows the player is allowed to choose their name. In order to make it out alive in the seven days, the player needs to choose carefully what tasks to do, depending on the resources he or she has and amount of health is remaining. Each function carries out the task needed to find food, eat food, find wood, and build a fire. Performing each task takes damage to whatever resource is being used and requires a certain amount of a resource to perform a task. For example, in order for the player to build a fire, he or she needs 5 points of wood, which builds a fire of two points. \n",
    "\n",
    "I have also built a class called SurvivalGame, which carries out the seven day challenge of survival. The player starts with a health of 50 points and knife durability of 7 points, which is needed to find food and wood. The player has 5 tasks to choose from and if the player doesn't have enough resources to do the task, a message should show indicating so. After each turn, a day passes by and health takes damage depending on what task is performed. "
